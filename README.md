# ApprienObjectiveCExampleGame
Contains small game IAP man that demonstrates how Apprien can be used in a game.
Good starting point is GameManager.h file that contains explanataion and documentation about 
how things work.

Other notable thing is that the Game manager is created in the GameViewController class in IOS folder.

It's also responsible for reading player input for now.
